 - Are there things that you're currently doing manually in a GUI?
Do you ever pass instructions to colleagues that involve a number of
individual "click this button," "select this item" steps? Could these be
automated?

 - Whenever you move to a new environment, make a point of
finding out what shells are available. See if you can bring your
current shell with you.

 - Investigate alternatives to your current shell. If you come across
a problem your shell can't address, see if an alternative shell would
cope better.

 - Some editors use full-blown languages for customization and
scripting. Emacs, for example, uses Lisp. As one of the new
languages you are going to learn this year, learn the language your
editor uses. For anything you find yourself doing repeatedly, develop
a set of macros (or equivalent) to handle it.

 - Do you know everything your editor is capable of doing? Try to
stump your colleagues who use the same editor. Try to accomplish
any given editing task in as few keystrokes as possible.
